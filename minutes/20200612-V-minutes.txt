Issues discussed:

#434 SLEN=VLEN as optional extension

We spent the meeting discussing the register layout options.

We reviewed the alternate approaches other ISAs had taken in handling
widening options, and will update a doc outlining the approaches
others have taken.

Discussion centered around possible microarchitectural approaches to
preserving SLEN=VLEN model in wider machines.  There was concern over
the effect of width-oblivious register spill/restore code on
techniques to hide internal layout.  Discussion to continue on mailing
list.

Meetings moved to every week to attempt to close spec to 1.0 by end of
June.
