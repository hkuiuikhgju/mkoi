A short meeting discussing only:

#545 Vector AMO Encoding

The group discussed the issue with vector AMO overlapping the desired
space for future scalar AMOs.  The group agreed with the proposal to
leave vector AMOs out of the v1.0 specification to allow time to
revisit the encoding taking into account the needs of scalar AMOs.
