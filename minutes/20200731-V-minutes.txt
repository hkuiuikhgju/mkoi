Issues discussed:

# ISA document formatting

For a large part of the meeting, we discussed the pull request to add
better register diagrams.  The consensus was that attendees preferred
the improved formatting, and would like to see similar formatting
across RISC-V specs.  We will merge the changes in to vector spec once
the table-of-contents facility is added to the html and pdf build
flows.

# "V" profile, #533 VLEN>=128 for V

We had extensive discussion around requiring "V base for application
processors to have VLEN>=128.  Some argued for a larger size, 256, but
there was general agreeement that 128 would match current expectations
for application processors.
